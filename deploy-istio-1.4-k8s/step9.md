## Observability 

#### Distributed Tracing
Distributed tracing enables users to track a request through mesh that is distributed across multiple services. This allows a deeper understanding about request latency, serialization and parallelism via visualization.
 
#### Remotely Accessing Jeager Addons

1. Apply networking configuration for the Jeager addons.
`kubectl apply -f assets/jeager.yaml`{{execute}}
1. Visit the Jeager via browser.

#### Generating traces using the Bookinfo sample

To see trace data, you must send requests to your service. The number of requests depends on Istioâ€™s sampling rate. You set this rate when you install Istio. The default sampling rate is 1%. You need to send at least 100 requests before the first trace is visible. To send a 100 requests to the productpage service, use the following command:

`watch -n 1 curl -o /dev/null -s -w %{http_code} $GATEWAY_URL/productpage`{{execute}}
